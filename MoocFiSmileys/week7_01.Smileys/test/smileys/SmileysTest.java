   It's a good idea to first think how many smileys should be printed for a character string of a certain length.
   The length of a character string can be found out with the method length which belongs to it. A loop is helpful
   for printing the top and bottom smiley rows, the middle row can be handled with a normal print command. You can
   check if a length is an odd number with the help of a remainder characterString.length() % 2 == 1.
